To run the game, launch index.html

The goal of the game is to get your score as high as possible before you lose all your lives.

Points are awarded for collecting gems and for making it to the other side of the road.  1 point for each gem and 2 points for crossing the road.

Any time you touch a bug, you lose a life.  Once all 3 lives are gone, your score will return to 0.
